# Terrain Parameter Configuration
# ================================
# Edit this file to tune terrain generation parameters.
# Run `make tune-terrain` to generate preview images.
#
# WORKFLOW:
#   1. Edit center values below
#   2. Run: make tune-terrain
#   3. View images in terrain_output/
#   4. Pick the best looking terrain
#   5. Update center values based on your choice
#   6. Repeat until satisfied

# ============ SEED ============
# Random seed for reproducibility.
# Use 0 for random seed, or a specific number to reproduce terrain.
seed = 0

# ============ NOISE PARAMETERS ============
# Each parameter has a _center value and _splay toggle.
# When splay is true, variations will be generated around the center.

# OCTAVES (range: 1-8, default: 6)
# Number of noise layers stacked together.
# Lower (1-3): Smooth, rolling hills
# Higher (6-8): More detailed, rough terrain
octaves_center = 6
octaves_splay = true

# LACUNARITY (range: 1.5-3.0, default: 2.0)
# Frequency multiplier between octaves.
# Controls how quickly detail increases at smaller scales.
# Higher values: sharper distinction between feature sizes
lacunarity_center = 2.0
lacunarity_splay = true

# PERSISTENCE (range: 0.2-0.8, default: 0.5)
# Amplitude multiplier between octaves.
# Controls how much fine detail shows through.
# Lower (0.2-0.4): Smoother, dominated by large features
# Higher (0.6-0.8): Rougher, more visible fine detail
persistence_center = 0.25
persistence_splay = true

# SCALE (range: 0.01-0.1, default: 0.025)
# Base noise frequency - controls overall feature size.
# Lower (0.01-0.02): Large mountains/valleys
# Higher (0.05-0.1): Smaller, more frequent hills
scale_center = 0.025
scale_splay = true

# ============ HEIGHT MAPPING ============
# These control the output height range in voxels.
height_min = 0
height_max = 12

# ============ SPLAY CONFIGURATION ============
# Controls how variations are generated.

# Number of variations per parameter (usually 4: -large, -small, +small, +large)
variations_per_param = 4

# Splay amounts as fractions of center value
splay_small = 0.20
splay_large = 0.50

# ============ OUTPUT ============
output_dir = terrain_output
image_width = 512
image_height = 512

# Export grayscale heightmap (height -> brightness)
export_heightmap = true

# Export colored visualization (uses game terrain colors)
export_colored = true
